    "Python, one of the most widely used programming languages. Apart from making fun computergames like 'rock, paper, siccors', it can also be used to solve financial problems. Like analysing America's biggest indexes, the NASDAQ100 and SP500. That is what I am going to show you. I will walk through a few of the basics of financial data analysis.

This is also true in reality since the NASDAQ is an index that is spread over 100 reasonably related shares, whereas the SP500 is spread over 500 less related shares, so the deviation is less, because if one stock in SP500 decreases in price it less likely that other shares will do the same. So here the risk is lower, but there is also less chance to make a large profit. So it may be a good investment for more risk averse people."

Whereby a negative correlation means that if one rises in price, the other has a great chance of decreasing in price. This high positive correlation shows that if one rises, the chance that the other one rises as well is very large. This can also be seen in the earlier made graphs.
